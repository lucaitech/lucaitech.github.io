  <h1>IAM & MFA Implementation</h1>

  <p>
    This project highlights my hands-on experience managing identity and access across two major
    platforms: Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) and Okta. My responsibilities included assigning roles,
    enforcing MFA, onboarding users, and ensuring access controls aligned with security policies.
    All examples below are fictionalized but accurately reflect the workflows I performed.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Role Assignment in Microsoft Entra</h2>
  <p>
    In Microsoft Entra, I regularly assigned and adjusted user roles based on job function,
    least-privilege principles, and access requests. This included both built-in roles and
    custom roles depending on the environment.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assigning roles such as Global Reader, User Administrator, and Application Administrator</li>
    <li>Reviewing access requests for accuracy and necessity</li>
    <li>Ensuring users were placed in the correct security groups</li>
    <li>Removing elevated roles when no longer required</li>
    <li>Validating permissions after assignment</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <strong>Example Role Assignment (Fictional):</strong><br><br>
    User: <em>jsmith@company.com</em><br>
    Requested Role: <em>User Administrator</em><br>
    Verification: Confirmed with manager + ticket approval<br>
    Action: Role assigned, group membership updated<br>
    Follow-Up: Verified access by checking Entra audit logs
  </div>

  <h2>2. Okta MFA Setup & User Onboarding</h2>
  <p>
    I also handled MFA enrollment and troubleshooting in Okta. This included onboarding new users,
    enforcing MFA policies, and assisting employees with device or authentication issues.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Activating Okta accounts for new hires</li>
    <li>Enforcing MFA enrollment (Okta Verify, SMS, or Email)</li>
    <li>Resetting MFA factors when users changed devices</li>
    <li>Unlocking accounts and clearing authentication attempts</li>
    <li>Ensuring users completed MFA setup before accessing sensitive systems</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <strong>Example MFA Setup (Fictional):</strong><br><br>
    User: <em>mgarcia@company.com</em><br>
    Issue: New phone → Okta Verify not transferring<br>
    Action: Reset Okta factors + re-enrolled user<br>
    Result: Successful MFA login validated through Okta logs
  </div>

  <h2>3. Access Control Improvements</h2>
  <p>
    By coordinating role assignments in Entra and MFA enforcement in Okta, I helped strengthen
    identity security and reduce unauthorized access risks. My work contributed to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cleaner role assignments aligned with least privilege</li>
    <li>Consistent MFA coverage across the organization</li>
    <li>Reduced authentication issues through proactive support</li>
    <li>Improved audit readiness through accurate access records</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Final Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates my ability to manage identity lifecycle tasks, enforce MFA,
    and maintain secure access controls across multiple platforms. These workflows directly
    supported the organization’s security posture and compliance requirements.
