  <h1>IRP Maturity Gap Closure Project</h1>
  <p>
    A post‑acquisition initiative focused on aligning two Incident Response Plans (IRPs),
    identifying maturity gaps, and elevating the combined organization’s response posture
    to industry best‑practice standards.
  </p>
</header>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    After our organization acquired another financial‑sector entity, I was tasked with
    evaluating the differences between both Incident Response Plans (IRPs). The goal was
    to identify maturity gaps, benchmark both plans against industry best practices, and
    propose enhancements that would unify and strengthen the combined IRP.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work required strict confidentiality, careful redaction, and a methodical
    approach to ensure no sensitive information was exposed while still improving the
    organization’s operational readiness and regulatory alignment.
  </p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare both IRPs at a structural and procedural level</li>
    <li>Identify gaps in maturity, clarity, and best‑practice alignment</li>
    <li>Recommend enhancements to strengthen response posture</li>
    <li>Ensure all improvements remained compliant and non‑identifying</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Findings & Improvements Proposed</h2>

  <h3 style="color:#00b3ff;">1. RACI Matrix Integration</h3>
  <p>
    The acquired entity used a structured RACI model to clarify responsibilities across
    all response phases. Our IRP referenced roles but lacked a formalized matrix.
    I recommended implementing a high‑level, role‑based RACI to improve accountability
    and cross‑team coordination.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00b3ff;">2. Incident Severity Classification</h3>
  <p>
    The acquired IRP included a clear severity scale defining low, medium, high, and
    critical incidents. Our IRP stated severity would be defined but did not include a
    visual or descriptive matrix. I proposed adding a severity chart to reduce ambiguity
    and standardize escalation.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00b3ff;">3. Notification Flow & Escalation Triggers</h3>
  <p>
    The acquired IRP documented escalation logic, communication timelines, and decision
    points. I recommended adding a notification flow diagram to our IRP outlining when
    escalation occurs, who is notified, and expected communication timelines.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00b3ff;">4. Testing, Training & Exercises (TT&E)</h3>
  <p>
    Both organizations conducted tabletop exercises and simulations, but only the
    acquired entity documented them. I recommended adding TT&E details, including
    frequency and exercise types, to demonstrate operational maturity.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00b3ff;">5. Compliance Measurement & Reporting</h3>
  <p>
    The acquired IRP outlined compliance ownership and reporting cadence. I recommended
    adding a compliance governance section describing how adherence is tracked and how
    continuous improvement is measured.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00b3ff;">6. Emergency Contacts & Cyber Insurance</h3>
  <p>
    The acquired IRP included a role‑based emergency contact section and cyber insurance
    considerations. I recommended adding a non‑sensitive, role‑based contact section to
    our IRP to improve clarity during high‑pressure events.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00b3ff;">7. Definitions & Lessons Learned Process</h3>
  <p>
    The acquired IRP included definitions and step‑by‑step breakdowns for concepts like
    “incident closure” and “post‑incident analysis.” I recommended adding a definitions
    appendix and outlining our lessons‑learned workflow, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Post‑incident review</li>
    <li>Root cause analysis</li>
    <li>Response evaluation</li>
    <li>Documentation</li>
    <li>Policy updates</li>
    <li>Knowledge sharing</li>
    <li>Training & testing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    The final deliverable was a structured set of recommendations that significantly
    strengthened the organization’s IRP. The enhancements improved clarity,
    accountability, communication flow, compliance posture, and operational readiness.
    This project demonstrated my ability to perform IRP maturity assessments, benchmark
    against best practices, and drive cross‑team alignment during post‑acquisition
    integration — all while maintaining strict confidentiality in a regulated
    financial environment.
