  <h1>My Journey Into Cybersecurity</h1>

  <p>
    I got into tech the same way a lot of 90s kids did — through gaming. When your machine couldn’t run the newest DOOM or Warcraft, you had two choices: give up, or hop on your bike and ride to the only computer shop in town for a stick of RAM that <em>had</em> to be the magic fix. That was me. One upgrade turned into another, and before long I was swapping hard drives, power supplies, and eventually building my first PC from scratch with a friend coaching me through the nerve‑wracking process. That moment stuck with me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though I didn’t start my professional life in IT, tech never really left my orbit. It followed me into audio production, video editing, and graphic design — and it definitely made me the unofficial “family tech support” guy. It was always there, waiting for me to take it seriously.
  </p>

  <p>
    When COVID hit in 2019 and entire industries collapsed, I had to make a choice. I went back to the one thing I knew I could rely on: tech. I landed a Tier 1 help desk role, and years of AV work in high‑pressure hotel environments had already sharpened my customer service instincts. Over the next few years, I grew into a strong Level 1 and Level 2 technician.
  </p>

  <p>
    By 2023, I knew I wanted more. Cybersecurity wasn’t a random pivot — it was a natural progression. I was already helping with anti‑phishing efforts, managing access in Varonis, offboarding accounts in AD, and honestly, I’ve always loved criminology and cybercrime. It just clicked.
  </p>

  <p>
    I earned my Google Cybersecurity Certificate, asked a lot of questions, and had the support of an open‑minded Security Operations Manager who gave me room to grow. That’s where I developed hands‑on experience with CrowdStrike, Varonis, Rapid7, Splunk, SolarWinds, Wiz, change management, and risk and governance work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I’m continuing that journey. I’m studying for the CISA and leaning deeper into Governance, Risk, and Compliance — a space where I see my future and where I’m ready to put everything I’ve got.
