  <h1>Phishing Reduction Initiative</h1>

  <p>
    This project highlights my hands-on work responding to phishing reports, educating users,
    and improving overall security awareness. While I did not run formal phishing campaigns,
    I played a key role in reducing successful phishing attempts by investigating suspicious
    emails, guiding employees, and reinforcing safe behavior. All examples below are fictionalized
    but accurately reflect the workflows I performed.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Investigating Reported Phishing Emails</h2>
  <p>
    Employees frequently forwarded suspicious emails for review. My job was to quickly determine
    whether the message was malicious, benign, or part of a known phishing pattern.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Inspecting sender domains and reply-to mismatches</li>
    <li>Checking embedded URLs for redirects or spoofed login pages</li>
    <li>Reviewing attachments for macros or unusual file types</li>
    <li>Comparing messages to known phishing templates</li>
    <li>Checking threat intel feeds for related campaigns</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <strong>Example Investigation (Fictional):</strong><br><br>
    Subject: <em>“Urgent: Payroll Update Required”</em><br>
    Indicators: Suspicious domain, mismatched branding, fake HR signature<br>
    Action: Blocked sender, warned user, added domain to email filter<br>
    Result: Prevented further delivery to additional employees
  </div>

  <h2>2. User Coaching & Awareness</h2>
  <p>
    A major part of reducing phishing risk came from one-on-one coaching. When users reported
    suspicious emails—or fell for one—I helped them understand what happened and how to avoid
    similar threats in the future.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Explaining red flags (urgent language, mismatched domains, fake signatures)</li>
    <li>Showing users how to preview links safely</li>
    <li>Helping employees verify unexpected requests</li>
    <li>Encouraging use of the “Report Phishing” button</li>
    <li>Reinforcing that reporting is always better than ignoring</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <strong>Example User Coaching (Fictional):</strong><br><br>
    User: <em>kthomas@company.com</em><br>
    Issue: Clicked a suspicious link but did not enter credentials<br>
    Action: Guided user through password reset + explained indicators<br>
    Result: User became a consistent reporter of suspicious emails
  </div>

  <h2>3. Reducing Repeat Offenders</h2>
  <p>
    Some employees struggled more than others with identifying phishing attempts. I worked with
    these individuals directly to build confidence and reduce risky behavior.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reviewing past phishing attempts with the user</li>
    <li>Explaining why they were targeted</li>
    <li>Helping them recognize patterns in malicious emails</li>
    <li>Ensuring MFA and password hygiene were in place</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Strengthening Organizational Awareness</h2>
  <p>
    While I didn’t run formal phishing campaigns, my work contributed to a noticeable improvement
    in user behavior. Employees became more proactive in reporting suspicious messages, and fewer
    incidents required escalation.
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    <strong>Impact (Fictionalized but realistic):</strong><br><br>
    - Increase in phishing reports from employees<br>
    - Decrease in users clicking suspicious links<br>
    - Faster identification of malicious senders<br>
    - Fewer escalations to security leadership
  </div>

  <h2>5. Final Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates my ability to investigate phishing attempts, educate users, and
    strengthen organizational awareness. By combining technical analysis with clear communication,
    I helped reduce phishing-related risks and improve overall security posture.
